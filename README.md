# Project Name

Server side Calculator

## Description

In this project a calculator was designed to take a user input and post it to the server where the data will be held. once data is held in the server the get call is can be used to get the data back to the client side and then displayed on the dom. the input calculation was done in the post call on the serverside and then was pushed into the history object. once the calculation was stored in the history it could be retreived by the client and displayed as a total along with updating the history list. it was a challenge to figure out how to know from the dom if a operator button was pushed so that took some time to figure out how to highlight the button that had been selected so the user would know what operator they where on.
